<b> Recommendations with IBM <b>


In this project I analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles.

Introduction
The goal of the project is to do recommendation of the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform is performed. Here are the main steps:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis II. Rank Based Recommendations III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering IV. Content Based Recommendations V. Matrix Factorization

Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Recommendations-with-IBM/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
